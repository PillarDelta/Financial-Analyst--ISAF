## Key Features

- **ISAF-V2 (Integrated Strategic Analysis Framework)**: Advanced mathematical implementation using tensor operations for strategic analysis
- **Professional Report Formatting**: Clean, structured output with executive summaries and actionable recommendations
- **Cross-Framework Integration**: Integration between PESTEL, Porter's Five Forces, and SWOT analysis
- **Risk Assessment**: Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate strategic risks
- **Recommendation Generation**: Data-driven, context-specific strategic recommendations

## ISAF-V2 Framework

The Integrated Strategic Analysis Framework (ISAF) Version 2 combines qualitative business analysis with mathematical modeling to provide comprehensive strategic insights. Key components include:

### Mathematical Implementation

- **Tensor Operations**: Transforms qualitative factors into mathematical tensors
- **Cross-Framework Coupling**: Matrices that capture interactions between frameworks
- **Hyperfunctional Equation**: Core mathematical model for strategic state evaluation
- **Eigendecomposition**: Identifies key strategic factors with maximum impact
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Assesses risk and robustness of strategic decisions

### Output Format

The framework generates professional reports with:

- **Executive Summary**: Highlights key findings and strategic fit score
- **Key Findings**: Core factors that significantly impact strategic outcomes
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Actionable, tailored recommendations with confidence levels
- **Methodology**: Explanation of the analytical approach used

## Getting Started

To use the strategic analysis functionality:

```typescript
// Process a strategic analysis with ISAF-V2
const analysisText = "... your strategic analysis text ...";
const result = processWithISAFV2(analysisText);
console.log(result);
```

## Implementation Details

The ISAF-V2 process follows these steps:

1. **Factor Extraction**: Extracts PESTEL factors, Five Forces, and SWOT elements
2. **Mathematical Modeling**: Applies tensor mathematics to model interactions
3. **Strategic State Calculation**: Computes the integrated strategic state
4. **Factor Decomposition**: Identifies core factors with significant impact
5. **Risk Analysis**: Performs Monte Carlo simulations for risk assessment
6. **Recommendation Generation**: Creates tailored, actionable recommendations
7. **Report Formatting**: Structures the output in a professional format

## Recommendation System

The advanced recommendation system generates:

- **Factor-Specific Recommendations**: Based on the specific strategic factors identified
- **Cross-Framework Recommendations**: Derived from interactions between frameworks
- **Risk Mitigation Recommendations**: Based on Monte Carlo simulation results

Each recommendation includes:
- Action title and description
- Confidence level
- Impact score
- Time horizon and resource intensity
- Supporting factors
- Financial impact assessment

## Technical Requirements

- Node.js environment
- TypeScript support
- No external mathematical libraries required (pure JS implementation)
