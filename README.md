## Key Features

- **ISAF-V2 (Integrated Strategic Analysis Framework)**: Advanced mathematical implementation using tensor operations for strategic analysis
- **Professional Report Formatting**: Clean, structured output with executive summaries and actionable recommendations
- **Cross-Framework Integration**: Integration between PESTEL, Porter's Five Forces, and SWOT analysis
- **Risk Assessment**: Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate strategic risks
- **Recommendation Generation**: Data-driven, context-specific strategic recommendations

## ISAF-V2 Framework

The Integrated Strategic Analysis Framework (ISAF) Version 2 combines qualitative business analysis with mathematical modeling to provide comprehensive strategic insights. Key components include:

### Mathematical Implementation

- **Tensor Operations**: Transforms qualitative factors into mathematical tensors
- **Cross-Framework Coupling**: Matrices that capture interactions between frameworks
- **Hyperfunctional Equation**: Core mathematical model for strategic state evaluation
- **Eigendecomposition**: Identifies key strategic factors with maximum impact
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Assesses risk and robustness of strategic decisions

### Output Format

The framework generates professional reports with:

- **Executive Summary**: Highlights key findings and strategic fit score
- **Key Findings**: Core factors that significantly impact strategic outcomes
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Actionable, tailored recommendations with confidence levels
- **Methodology**: Explanation of the analytical approach used

## Getting Started

To use the strategic analysis functionality:

```typescript
// Process a strategic analysis with ISAF-V2
const analysisText = "... your strategic analysis text ...";
const result = processWithISAFV2(analysisText);
console.log(result);
```

## Implementation Details

The ISAF-V2 process follows these steps:

1. **Factor Extraction**: Extracts PESTEL factors, Five Forces, and SWOT elements
2. **Mathematical Modeling**: Applies tensor mathematics to model interactions
3. **Strategic State Calculation**: Computes the integrated strategic state
4. **Factor Decomposition**: Identifies core factors with significant impact
5. **Risk Analysis**: Performs Monte Carlo simulations for risk assessment
6. **Recommendation Generation**: Creates tailored, actionable recommendations
7. **Report Formatting**: Structures the output in a professional format

## Recommendation System

The advanced recommendation system generates:

- **Factor-Specific Recommendations**: Based on the specific strategic factors identified
- **Cross-Framework Recommendations**: Derived from interactions between frameworks
- **Risk Mitigation Recommendations**: Based on Monte Carlo simulation results

Each recommendation includes:
- Action title and description
- Confidence level
- Impact score
- Time horizon and resource intensity
- Supporting factors
- Financial impact assessment

## Technical Requirements

- Node.js environment
- TypeScript support
- No external mathematical libraries required (pure JS implementation)

## GPT-ISAF Integration

The platform integrates GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) with ISAF (Integrated Strategic Analysis Framework) to provide enhanced strategic analysis capabilities. This integration combines the qualitative analysis from GPT with quantitative mathematical modeling from ISAF to deliver more robust strategic recommendations.

### Academic Foundation

The ISAF-V2 system is based on the proprietary paper "ISAF: A Integrated Strategic Analysis Framework - Mathematical Synthesis and Computational Strategic Analysis." developed by Kyriakos Taraktis at Pillar Delta. This groundbreaking paper introduces a mathematical formalism that combines traditional qualitative business frameworks (PESTEL, Porter's Five Forces, SWOT) into a unified quantitative model using tensor mathematics.

Key elements from the paper that we've implemented:

- The strategic state function S(X, t) = ℱ(Φ_E(E, t), Φ_C(C, t), Φ_R(R, t); Θ(t))
- Cross-framework coupling matrices to quantify interactions between frameworks
- Eigendecomposition to identify strategic leverage points
- Monte Carlo simulation framework for strategic risk assessment

### How It Works

1. **Initial Analysis**: When a user inputs a strategic query, GPT performs an initial qualitative analysis using PESTEL, Porter's Five Forces, and SWOT frameworks.

2. **Factor Extraction**: The ISAF system extracts structured factors from GPT's output, including:
   - PESTEL factors with weights, impacts, and uncertainty levels
   - Competitive forces with strength assessments and influence relationships
   - SWOT elements with impact scores

3. **Mathematical Processing**: ISAF performs mathematical calculations on these factors:
   - Eigendecomposition to identify dominant factors
   - Cross-impact matrix calculations between frameworks
   - Monte Carlo simulations for uncertainty analysis
   - Strategic fit tensor calculations

4. **Confidence Assessment**: The system evaluates the quality of extracted data and provides transparency about confidence levels:
   - Framework completeness percentages
   - Data quality indicators ("high-confidence", "medium-confidence", or "indicative")
   - Confidence scores for each recommendation

5. **Output Generation**: The final output includes:
   - Strategic fit score with confidence level
   - Key findings based on mathematical analysis
   - Strategic recommendations with prioritization
   - Methodology explanation

### Recent Improvements

#### Enhanced Factor Extraction
- Improved pattern recognition algorithms for more accurate extraction of PESTEL, Five Forces, and SWOT elements
- Better handling of ambiguous or incomplete sections in the input text
- More accurate weight and impact calculations based on textual emphasis
- Enhanced classification of strategic factors with proper naming

#### Output Formatting Enhancements
- Redesigned report format with professional box-style headers and clear section dividers
- Improved visual hierarchy with better spacing and typography
- Added star rating system (, , ) for recommendation confidence levels
- Better organization of implementation details for clearer action plans
- Enhanced context preservation to maintain important insights from the original analysis

#### System Reliability
- Added comprehensive validation to ensure analysis quality
- Implemented better error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Added transparency about data quality and confidence levels
- Ensured the system always processes actual input data rather than sample data

These improvements combine to deliver strategic analysis that is not only mathematically rigorous but also visually appealing and easy to understand, with clear indications of confidence and data quality to support decision-making.

### Output Example

Here's a simplified example of how the improved formatting appears in the platform:

```

              STRATEGIC ANALYSIS REPORT            


Executive Summary:
- The analysis identified key strategic factors across environmental, competitive, and 
  organizational dimensions.
- Mathematical modeling reveals 5 critical factors that significantly 
  impact strategic outcomes.
- The integrated model projects a strategic fit score of 80.1% (high-confidence).



Data Quality Assessment:
- Analysis based on 19 extracted data points 
  (95% of framework elements).
- Framework completeness: PESTEL (86%), 
  Five Forces (100%), 
  SWOT (100%).



Strategic Recommendations:
1. Strategic Market Positioning [ 71%]
   • Leverage organizational strengths by expanding their application across markets and 
     product lines, creating initiatives that maximize your competitive advantage.
   
   • Implementation:
     - Time horizon: immediate
     - Resource intensity: high
     - Impact potential: 10/10
```

This professional formatting makes the output more readable and emphasizes the key information needed for strategic decision-making.
