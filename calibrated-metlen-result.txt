**MATHEMATICAL METHODOLOGY:**
• pestelOperator: PESTEL operator calculates weighted impact using Σ(weight_i × probability_i × impact_i) normalized by total weight
• fiveForcesOperator: Five Forces operator measures industry attractiveness as 1 - Σ(force_i × Σ(influence_ij)) / n
• swotOperator: SWOT operator computes organizational effectiveness using tensor sum Σ(internal_i × external_j × interaction_ij)
• hyperfunctionalEquation: Strategic state S(t) = PESTEL + Forces + SWOT + Coupling_Effects × temporal_decay(t)
• couplingMatrices: Cross-framework interactions quantified through deterministic coupling coefficients
• optimization: Strategy optimization uses systematic grid search over decision space
• validation: Model validation employs RMSE, MAE, and R-squared statistical measures
